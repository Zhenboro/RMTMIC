# RMTMIC 
Stream de audio TCP/IP  

## Using it
First, my english is bad af.  

1. Start RMTMIC Listener, put the Client IP and Port and then click on the Connect button. This will start the connection with the Client Server.  
2. In another computer (the one you want to hear) start RMTMIC Client with parameters. "`--port-15243`" and "`/startmicstreaming`"  
3. Enjoy!. RMTDSK Listener will start to stream the another's computer audio mic.  

## Yeah.
